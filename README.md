When it comes to CSS validation - there were no errors found.

HTML validation on the other hand gives three warnings about tags that were used to increase size of the social media icons in the navigation bar:

BUGS ALONG THE WAY

While working on "OLD BARN" project, an interesting situation developed around social media icons. 
Although there is an overline rule applied when hovering over navigation elements - icons do not respond. Reason thus far unknown.
