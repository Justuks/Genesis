# **Problems Encountered.**
### Two issues were present during development stages.
### First of all, the images from HTML files would not show.
### This situation was also observed during the course exercises.
### Used same project images as a background in CSS and it worked without problems.
### Second issue, which manifested itself, was with the social media icons
### that did not respond to hovering command.
![Links](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147477232-f7fa2499-a35c-48b3-9719-ae741579bac8.png)
### Creator had the wrong peception that once hovering command is given to a link - all links
### will respond. However, after consultation with tutors it became aparent that icons must be 
### addressed specifically by unique selectors. The issue was fixed, although after reviewing 
### the end results - hovering for the icons was dropped due to insuficient contrast.
#  
#  
# **Deployment.**
### Project was developed using GitPod as a building platform.
### Project was published on GitHub platform at: https://justuks.github.io/Genesis/
