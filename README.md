# **Features.**

## **Navigation Bar**
![Navigation links](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147421179-ed3e3358-6344-45ab-a181-4754e64b286a.png)
### Navigation links are easy to use. Besides two internal conectors, there are links to
### organization's social media accounts.
### All links, except social media icons, respond to hovering by displaying an underline.

## **Current Page Indicator**
![Current page label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147421343-6548e239-309f-4539-a6ac-d2a48c553820.png)
### All pages have an 'indicator' showing what section of a website user is in.
### This feature helps website pages to look and feel more user-friendly as well as
### it is indirect aid when it comes to navigating.

## **What We Do**
![Main Declaration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147421621-9e2cffb4-0809-4e79-86ae-ff0c335ff910.png)
### This is the main declaration in a home page of what the organization is all about.
### It is a mixture of textual and visual statements that complement each other.

## **Footer**
![Footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147421818-d9420e58-c6a7-4fd3-99ce-ab6fe82dcdca.png)
### Footer section carries a very important link, which brings users back to the top of the page.
### This feature eliminates the need to use a vertical scroll bar, adding to better user experience.
### Within the footer there are also the details of an author.

## **Gallery**
![Gallery Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147484001-d12a8539-9c68-4895-943a-d964968e3d22.png)
### Gallery page consists of slots with images that directly or indirectly support 
### organizations' mission.
### Needless to say that the images can be taken out and new ones can be inserted if need be.

## **Contact Us**
![Contact Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147454909-ca60c7e6-1ed1-419c-9073-f3500803fc4b.png)
### This is very important section and as a result it is laid oud in a very clear configuration
### without the unecessary 'bells and whistles' in a shape of tables or forms.
### Map, which sits below main contact details, strongly contributes to contact section when it
### comes to user experience.
#  
#  
# **Responsiveness.**
### In order to achieve high user satisfaction while using different devices -
### 'break-point' concept was applied.

### Elements were styled in such a way, that once below indicated pixel treshold, website 
### maintained the same 'flow and feel'. 
#  
#  
# **Testing.**
### During development phase, project and its feature performance were constantly checked
### using 'Developer Tools'. 
### 'Developer Tools' and its 'Box Model' together with 'Different Device Emulation' were very 
### useful in configurating project responsiveness to smaller screen sizes.

## **Hardware and Virtual 'Test Beds'**
### Apart from testing website reactions to different screen sizes on 'DevTools' and
### http://ami.responsivedesign.is/# website,
### responsiveness was also crosschecked on physical devices such as HP PAVILION laptop, Samsung 
### Z Flip and Motorola G9 Play mobile phones.
### No issues were found and everything worked as intended.
#  
#  
# **W3C CSS and HTML Validation.**
### When checked, CSS returned with no errors found.
### However, there was a following warning displayed.
![Warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147469874-e6f2c642-272a-4ff2-ae30-9b7fd2282162.png)

### When it comes to HTML, all three html pages passed the tests,
### with no errors or warnings to show.

## **Lighthouse Report**
### When checking complete project with the 'Lighthouse' tool,
### it generated the following report.
![Lighthouse report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93588907/147470964-6dd2bc1b-f461-4ebc-acc9-a9d3dfc75b60.png)
#  
#  
# **Problems Encountered.**
### Two issues were present during development stages.
### First of all, the images from HTML files would not show.
### This situation was also observed during the course exercises.
### Used same project images as a background in CSS and it worked without problems.
### Second issue, which manifested itself, was with the social media icons
### that did not respond to hovering command.

### Creator had the wrong peception that once hovering command is given to a link - all links
### will respond. However, after consultation with tutors it became aparent that icons must be 
### addressed specifically by unique selectors. The issue was fixed, although after reviewing 
### the end results - hovering for the icons was dropped due to insuficient contrast.
#  
#  
# **Deployment.**
### Project was developed using GitPod as a building platform.
### Project was published on GitHub platform at: https://justuks.github.io/Genesis/
#  
#  
# **Credits.**
### This project would not have been achieved without the help and guidance of 
### my mentor Mr. Mo Shami, and also without helpful hand of:
- ### Slack Community

- ### And various online recources, such as: [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/)
